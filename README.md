# Prolog
# Quiz Proctor Assignment System 📝 

This Prolog-based system automates the assignment of teaching assistants (TAs) to supervise quizzes. It takes into account TA availability 🕗 , teaching schedules 📆, and day-off 🥱 preferences to ensure fair and efficient proctoring schedules⚡. The program dynamically calculates free slots and uses permutations for optimal proctor distribution.

## Features
- **Dynamic TA Availability Calculation**: Considers teaching schedules and days off.
- **Quiz Proctor Assignment**: Allocates TAs as proctors for quizzes based on required numbers and time slots.
- **Fair Distribution**: Ensures an equitable workload among TAs using permutations.
- **Flexible Design**: Customizable for different institution requirements.

## Requirements
- A Prolog interpreter (SWI-Prolog).

## How to Use
1. Define the list of TAs, their teaching schedules, and days off.
2. Provide quiz details (course, day, time slot, number of proctors needed).
3. Run the program to get the proctoring schedule.

This project is perfect for educational institutions and ensuring the ideas of logical programming.
